# Question and difficult point

##  579. https://leetcode.com/problems/find-cumulative-salary-of-an-employee/
### 1) cumulative salary: the time column should be both threshold and variable
#### hint: self join with a.time to be index and b.time to vary
#### Example: subquery should be used to define the new column (select salary from employee where month=b.month-1 and id=b.id )
### 2) in case syntax, else 0 may still output NULL, then you need to use ifnull to convert null into 0
### 3) calculate the column summation within each row: need to use column A + column B + column C instead of sum(A+B+C)
## 601. https://leetcode.com/problems/human-traffic-of-stadium/
